### Inspiration üåü
Our inspiration was rooted in a team member's disastrous experience building a PC. We realized there's a need for a more efficient system for PC novices to select the right components tailored to their needs and budget. Our goal: To revolutionize the way individuals approach PC building, using AI to guide users in choosing the optimal PC components for gaming, media editing, programming, etc.

### What it does üöÄ
EasyPC offers a comprehensive solution for custom PC builds. Users input their requirements, such as "high-end 3D editing under $2,000," and our AI recommends a complete part list. This includes prices, specs, and descriptions tailored to the user's intended workload. EasyPC stands out by providing direct, AI-driven recommendations that save users time, effort, and money.

### How we Built it üîß
We employed cutting-edge software, utilizing together.ai for our main AI system. Our AI, trained on vast data points, provides accurate recommendations. We also incorporated MindsDB for bulk jobs to generate precise descriptions of PC Parts. One challenge was creating a comprehensive database for PC parts. Using Selenium, we successfully scraped the required data, creating a dataset that serves our vision.

### Challenges we ran into üß©
Our journey was not without challenges:
- Integrating Flight Price APIs: Handling data from these APIs was complex.
- Setting Up the Basic Web Page: Creating a responsive webpage with Spotify links and location data was intricate.
- Web Scraping Spotify & Venue Data: Extracting essential data required specialized web scraping techniques.
- Learning JavaScript: Building the necessary algorithms posed a steep learning curve.
- Optimization Problem: Finding the most efficient solution for our challenges required careful strategizing.

However, our dedication and collaborative spirit helped us overcome these obstacles.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÜ
We are immensely proud of our innovative solution for obtaining data, our achievement in front-end development, our resourceful approach to challenges, and the collaborative teamwork that brought our vision to life.

### What we learned üå±
This project sharpened our skills in problem-solving, JavaScript, web scraping, Flask server setup, and operations management. We also gained invaluable insights into the intricacies of PC building and component selection.

### What's next for EasyPC üöÄ
Scaling is on the horizon. With our AI system in place, we plan to feed it more data and introduce a feature where users can ask any PC-related questions. We aim to continuously refine and expand our services, ensuring that EasyPC remains the go-to solution for custom PC builds.
